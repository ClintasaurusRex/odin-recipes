      <em>
        This recipe for Honey Garlic Chicken Thighs offers a simple yet flavorful dish that can be
        prepared in a skillet. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned and then seared until
        golden, after which a quick sauce made from honey, water, rice wine vinegar, and soy sauce
        is added to the pan with crushed garlic. The chicken simmers in this sweet and savory glaze
        until the sauce reduces and thickens, resulting in tender, sticky chicken thighs that are a
        crowd-pleasing option for a quick weeknight meal.

    <ul>
      <li>8 (5 ounce) boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>7 cloves garlic, chopped, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup honey</li>
      <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 pinch onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather All the ingredients</li>
      <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and brown on one
        side, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip chicken and add onion and garlic; continue to cook until chicken is mostly (but not
        fully) cooked and onion and garlic are soft, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove chicken to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add honey, soy sauce, onion powder, and garlic powder to the skillet. Stir and scrape the
        bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to get garlic and onion to mix with the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium. Cook until no longer pink
        in the center and juices run clear, about 10 more minutes, turning once halfway through. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a thigh should read at least 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange chicken on a serving plate and drizzle liquid from the pan on top. Sprinkle with
        cilantro to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
