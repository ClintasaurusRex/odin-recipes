        This recipe for Honey Garlic Chicken Thighs offers a simple yet flavorful dish that can be
        prepared in a skillet. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned and then seared until
        golden, after which a quick sauce made from honey, water, rice wine vinegar, and soy sauce
        is added to the pan with crushed garlic. The chicken simmers in this sweet and savory glaze
        until the sauce reduces and thickens, resulting in tender, sticky chicken thighs that are a
        crowd-pleasing option for a quick weeknight meal.
