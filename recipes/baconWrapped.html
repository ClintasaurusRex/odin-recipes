        >These bacon wrapped cheeseburger bites, made in the air fryer, are a little bit meatloaf
        and a little bit cheeseburger: seasoned ground beef meatballs with Cheddar cheese centers
        are wrapped in bacon and fried. They are delicious and reheat well, great as an appetizer or
        a main. Serve with any dipping sauce you like.</em

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef, 80/20 preferred</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
      <li>4 dill pickle chips, chopped</li>
      <li>4 ounces Cheddar cheese, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
      <li>9 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or as needed for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley flakes, salt,
        ketchup, mustard, and dill pickle in a bowl and mix until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pinch 1 generous tablespoon of meat mixture and wrap around 1 cube of cheese. Roll to form a
        ball, then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Continue with remaining meat
        mixture and cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut bacon slices in half widthwise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise, making 4 strips
        from each bacon slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap 1 bacon strip around each meatball, securing with a toothpick or pressed tightly into
        the meat to stay in place. Any extra strips of bacon can be used to do a second wrap on some
        of the meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line the bottom of the air fryer with half of the meatballs, then fry for 6 minutes. Turn
        them over and fry for another six minutes. Remove and repeat with remaining meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with your choice of dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
